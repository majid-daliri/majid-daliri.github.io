Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student at New York University, affiliated with [Theoretical Computer Science at NYU](https://cs.nyu.edu/theory-group/). I am immensely grateful to be under the guidance of [Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/), whose mentorship has been pivotal to my academic growth.

My research focuses on sketching data streaming processes, big data processing, and fast inference in large language models (LLMs) and transformers. These areas are explored from the perspective of theoretical computer science, statistics, information theory, and optimization, often intersecting with machine learning theory and graph applications. I am particularly fascinated by the theoretical foundations of randomized algorithms and the complex challenges they present in mathematical problem-solving.

Before my PhD, I completed a B.S. at the University of Tehran, where I had the privilege to collaborate with [Prof. Goharshady](https://www.goharshady.com/) and [Dr. Zandieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-zandieh-phd-323a13a9/).
