Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of NYU Tandon School of Engineering in the Algorithms and Foundations Group. I am fortunate to be advised by Christopher Musco.
I am broadly interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science, statistics, information theory, and optimization, sometimes in conjunction with machine learning theory and graph applications. I enjoy understanding the theoretical ground of randomized algorithms that are of practical importance and twiddling with complex mathematical problems. 
Prior to starting the Ph.D., I received a B.S from the University of Tehran. During my Bachelor's, I worked with Prof. Goharshady and Dr. Zandieh as an intern.
