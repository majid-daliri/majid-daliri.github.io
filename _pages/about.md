Hello! I'm a second-year PhD student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, actively involved with the Algorithms and Foundations Group. I am profoundly fortunate to be under the guidance of [Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/), whose mentorship has been invaluable to my academic journey.

My research passions lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science, statistics, information theory, and optimization. These areas frequently overlap with machine learning theory and graph applications. I'm deeply motivated by uncovering the theoretical underpinnings of randomized algorithms and tackling intricate mathematical problems.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I earned a B.S. from the University of Tehran. During this time, I had the incredible opportunity to work and learn alongside [Prof. Goharshady](https://www.goharshady.com/) and [Dr. Zandieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-zandieh-phd-323a13a9/).
