Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of NYU Tandon School of Engineering in the Algorithms and Foundations Group. I am fortunate to be advised by [Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science, statistics, information theory, and optimization, sometimes in conjunction with machine learning theory and graph applications. I enjoy understanding the theoretical ground of randomized algorithms that are of practical importance and twiddling with complex mathematical problems. 

Prior to starting the Ph.D., I received a B.S from the University of Tehran. During my Bachelor's, I worked with [Prof. Goharshady](https://www.goharshady.com/) and [Dr. Zandieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-zandieh-phd-323a13a9/) as an intern.
