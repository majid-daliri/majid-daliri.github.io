Hello! I'm a third-year PhD student at New York University, affiliated with [Theoretical Computer Science at NYU](https://cs.nyu.edu/theory-group/). I am immensely grateful to be under the guidance of [Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/), whose mentorship has been pivotal to my academic growth.

My research focuses on developing algorithms with provable guarantees to enhance the efficiency and scalability of machine learning systems, especially in the context of deep learning and generative AI. I design algorithms that are adaptable across diverse machine learning architectures and tasks, ensuring their relevance as technologies advance. My work addresses the economic and environmental sustainability concerns of machine learning systems by improving their computational efficiency without increasing resources.

Before my PhD, I completed a B.S. at the University of Tehran, where I had the privilege to collaborate with [Prof. Goharshady](https://www.goharshady.com/) and [Dr. Zandieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-zandieh-phd-323a13a9/).
